create 2 databases in postgreSQL, one called **listingz_users** and one called **listingz_listings**

Then under core/settings.py:

-   find the DATABASES setting, set the PASSWORD field to both your databases password to your postgreSQL user password

Once you have your databases setup, proceed to the following steps:

-   Virtual Enviornment is already present
-   simply activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate (MacOS) or .\venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

-   then run the following commands:

-   python manage.py makemigrations
-   python manage.py migrate user --database=users
-   python manage.py migrate --database=users
-   python manage.py migrate listing --database=listings
-   then run the following to create a superuser:
-   python manage.py createsuperuser --database=users
-   then you can run the server by running: python manage.py runserver
